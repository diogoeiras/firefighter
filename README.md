# FireFighter

Firefighter, built in Java and JADEX, is a multi-agent system that allows a simulation of a fire fighting in distinct environmental characteristics. The existing agents in the project are:

 - Fireman
> BDI agent who tries to extinguish the fire cells while saving Person agents. Has a vision range of 5 units, but he can only put down fire cells within 1 unit of distance.

 - Person
 > BDI agents that have no communication with other agents. His only interest is to save himself of dying.
